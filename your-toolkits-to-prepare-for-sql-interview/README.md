### Your Toolkits to Prepare for SQL Interview

- A common task from the data science interviews is that the company will give you the schema of the database and ask you to answer questions. 
- Without a concrete table to work on, you will not be able to test your query. So this session helps you to:
  - host a standalone MySQL database for practicing SQL.
  - create a (fake) table that you need for your practicing.
  - have a rough idea what a SQL window function, a popular type of interview questions nowadays, is doing.
